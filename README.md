# OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
PROJECT : EXPLORATION DATA ANALYSIS (EDA) 
# Objective :
To Start with a dataset  and perform EDA using libraries like pandas, numpy,
and matplotlib or seaborn. Explore the data's characteristics, distributions, correlations,
and outliers. Visualize the findings with histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to
gain insights into the data.

# Key Activities :
* Data Loading
* Data Cleaning
* Data Exploration
* Feature Analysis
* Data Visualization
* Analysis of relationship betwween variables

# Technologies Used
* Programming Language
Python: The primary language for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

# Libraries and Tools
* Data Manipulation
Pandas: For data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory operations.
NumPy: For numerical computations and handling arrays.

* Visualization
Seaborn: For statistical data visualization and aesthetically pleasing plots.

* Development Environment
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding, visualization, and documentation.
Anaconda: A distribution that simplifies managing Python libraries and dependencies.

# Key Insights:

* Identified behavioral and demographic factors impacting grades.
* Found significant correlations between study patterns, attendance, and performance.
* Highlighted actionable insights to improve educational outcomes.

## This repository contains the dataset, Python scripts, and visualizations used for the analysis, providing a comprehensive view of the project and its findings.
